# Docker Issues Fixed Summary

## Problem Solved
The application was experiencing the Docker error:
```
HTTPConnection.request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'chunked'
```

This error was caused by an incompatibility between the old docker-compose version (1.29.2) and the newer Docker version (27.5.1).

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Docker Compose Version Issue
**Root Cause:** Old docker-compose v1.29.2 was incompatible with Docker v27.5.1

**Solution:**
- Installed latest Docker Compose v2.39.1 in `~/.local/bin/`
- Updated `run.sh` script to automatically use the new version
- Created `fix-docker.sh` script for easy setup

**Files Modified:**
- `run.sh` - Updated `check_docker_compose()` function
- `fix-docker.sh` - Created new script for installation

### 2. Database Connectivity Timeout Issue
**Root Cause:** Backup script was hanging when trying to connect to database during restart

**Solution:**
- Added 10-second timeouts to database connectivity checks
- Added 60-second timeout to backup operations during restart
- Improved error handling and warning messages

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/backup_database.sh` - Added timeouts to `check_database()` function
- `run.sh` - Added timeout to `backup_database_safe()` function

## How to Use the Fixes

### Option 1: Use the fix script
```bash
./fix-docker.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual usage (current session)
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
./run.sh restart
```

### Option 3: Permanent fix
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
./run.sh restart
```

## Verification
After applying the fixes:
```bash
# Check docker-compose version
~/.local/bin/docker-compose --version
# Should show: Docker Compose version v2.39.1

# Test services
./run.sh restart
./run.sh status

# All services should be running:
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8000 ✓
# - Frontend: http://localhost:5173 ✓  
# - Admin Panel: http://localhost:8001 ✓
# - Database: localhost:5432 ✓
# - Redis: localhost:6379 ✓
```

## Entity CRUD Status
✅ **All entity CRUD operations are working properly:**

### Backend (reviewsite-backend/routers/entity_service.py)
- ✅ Create entities (POST /entities/)
- ✅ Update entities (PUT /entities/{id}) with authorization checks
- ✅ Delete entities (DELETE /entities/{id}) with confirmation and dependency checks
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and audit logging

### Frontend (reviewsite-frontend/src/api/services/entityService.ts)
- ✅ Entity creation with form data support
- ✅ Entity updates with partial data support  
- ✅ Entity deletion with confirmation
- ✅ User entities display in profile pages

## Additional Benefits
- ✅ Automatic database backups before restart/rebuild
- ✅ Graceful timeout handling prevents hanging
- ✅ Better error messages and warnings
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Files Added/Modified
