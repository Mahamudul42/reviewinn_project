## 🗑️ Files Removed/Cleaned Up

### Deleted Files:
- All `*.log` files (backend.log, server.log, etc.)
- All `*.pid` files (dev.pid, etc.)
- Temporary files (*.tmp, *.temp)
- `test_server.log` and other test artifacts
- Duplicate/outdated documentation

### Consolidated Files:
- **Multiple `*_SUMMARY.md` files** → Single `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- **Scattered documentation** → Organized in `docs/` subdirectories
- **Mixed scripts** → Organized by purpose in `scripts/` and `tools/`

## 📋 Key Improvements

### ✅ Organization
- **Clean root directory** - Only essential files remain
- **Logical grouping** - Related files are together
- **Easy navigation** - Developers can quickly find what they need
- **Professional structure** - Industry-standard organization

### ✅ Documentation
- **Comprehensive guides** in organized directories
- **Single changelog** instead of scattered summaries
- **Professional README** with clear project overview
- **Contributing guidelines** for team collaboration

### ✅ GitHub Ready
- **Issue templates** for bugs and features
- **PR template** with comprehensive checklist
- **Professional appearance** for open source
- **Easy onboarding** for new developers

### ✅ Development Workflow
- **Organized scripts** by database, development, deployment
- **Clear tooling** with migration, debug, validation tools
- **Environment setup** with .env.example template
- **Better maintainability** with logical file hierarchy

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Verify Everything Works
```bash
# Test the application still works
./run.sh start

# Check the new structure
ls -la
tree docs/ scripts/ tools/ data/
```

### 2. Commit the Clean Structure
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "refactor: restructure project for better organization

✨ Improvements:

- .github/ (issue templates, PR template)

This creates a professional, maintainable project structure
