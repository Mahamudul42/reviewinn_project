## What is ReviewInn?

ReviewInn is a modern, scalable review platform that allows users to review and rate entities (businesses, professionals, products, places) with advanced features including real-time messaging, gamification, and social interactions.

### Key Features ✨

- **Entity Management**: Comprehensive CRUD for businesses, professionals, products, places
- **Review System**: Rich reviews with ratings, reactions, comments, and version history
- **Real-time Messaging**: WebSocket-based messaging with conversation management
- **Gamification**: Badge system, progress tracking, and engagement analytics
- **Social Features**: Review circles, user connections, and notifications
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced search with analytics, trending, and recommendations
- **Admin Panel**: Django-based administration interface

## Architecture Highlights 🏗️

### Domain-Driven Design
- **6 Core Domains**: Auth, Entities, Reviews, Messaging, Gamification, Discovery
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain is independently maintainable and deployable
- **Event-Driven**: Domains communicate via domain events for loose coupling

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend:  React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite
Backend:   FastAPI + Python 3.11 + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
Database:  PostgreSQL 14 + Redis 7

## Development Workflow 🚀

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Prerequisites
docker --version    # Docker 20+
node --version      # Node.js 18+
python --version    # Python 3.11+

# Quick setup
git clone <repository>
cd reviewsite
docker compose up --build
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Backend development
cd reviewsite-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
